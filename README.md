# afs - Attributed File System

In my opinion a file system should file files without hierarchy like folders and sub-folders. 

The tree structure of folders and sub-folders commonly used should be consequently seen as just one possible kind of the attribution of attributes to these files. We observe it in any current operating system: how above the classic file system a virtual layer is added, in which files are presented in a virtual folder tree, which is built based on some attributes, like file type (images, sounds, ...) or last viewed, most liked, not used for a long time, not yet scanned, put into this and that and another album.

There are lots of promising file systems, respectively approaches. Scalability, robustness, access optimization, data deduplicators and redundancy producers (data safety, access optimization). But all those within one all-round, clear and simple concept? Nope. Think just of the typically not in-built search indexing... I feel database systems are much more powerful regarding that. 

Just a start. I'm thinking and investigating around that since a while. It becomes too big for one. So I decided to start sharing my findings and thoughts here, see the wiki, and a while later, from time to time, some partial solutions in software.
